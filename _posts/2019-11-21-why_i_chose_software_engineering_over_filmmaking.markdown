Hello, my name is Ethan Gustafson. I am originally from Rancho Cucamonga, California, and I have lived in the Orlando area since summer 2014. When I moved to Florida I became a student at Full Sail University to study Film Production. After graduating and working in the field as a freelancer for a few years, I learned that film production does not possess work that is fitting for me. It is a great hobby but not great work. I wanted a skill that I could start a new career with where I could have full time work with stability as opposed to only just having freelance. I wouldn't mind doing freelance as long as I already have a full time job in the field. 

So I did my research on who I am, what work could suit me, and what educational options are available to me. 

At first I thought about going back to college to pursue a different degree. I already have a bachelor of science under my belt, but unfortunatly the school I went to to obtain said bachelors had a different accreditation that would not carry class credits over to a regular college. 

I would have to obtain an A.A degree in two years and then move on to computer science for another two years. 

So I thought to myself, "Why isn't there like a trade school for programming?" Do you absolutely have to get an A.A degree in order to learn programming? I soon found out that there were actual online schools for programming that were called "Bootcamps." I could either teach myself how to code or I could go online and get taught the job through a bootcamp. Although it is preferred that you have a degree in most job postings for software developers, there were many that just required that you had the knowledge. It didn't matter if you had a degree as long as you can do the job. 

Since I didn't have the confidence that I could teach myself everything I needed to know to be successful in the industry, I went online and found CodeAcademy and Hack Reactor. After researching both bootcamps for some time I came to the conclusion that I could not attend either school. A few months later I found Flatiron. Flatiron included job success rates after graduation, a better platform for understanding code, and great financial options. I went through the bootcamp prep for HackReactor and I was not learning anything very well. The way it was laid out was just not very optimal for me as it was hard on the eyes and difficult to understand. 

The Flatiron bootcamp prep was laid out very neatly. I loved its format and that they were using special comparisons and metaphors to encapsulate what message or lesson that needed to get across. I loved that about the bootcamp prep. The lessons are laid out so you can go along step by step and actually understand what is going on. I would actually state that that was the point that I decided to stick with flatiron. I'm loving the process of working with classmates and the cohort leaders to further understanding and knowledge in coding. I'm looking forward of what is to come!
