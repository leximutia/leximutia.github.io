There is a bit of a story behind why I fixated specifically on Software Engineering. The career prospects are only a single aspect of it.

See. A computer programming job was what brought my family to the US, specifically my father (who then brought my mother, my sister, and me with him, as well as the rest of his brothers, their wives, and their children here).

I was born in Manila, Philippines to wonderful parents. My mother was a nurse, and my father was a professor. He'd graduated with a degree in Computer Science and (if I recall correctly) a degree in Political Science. In search of greater opportunity for me and my younger sister and generally a better life for his family, he searched then applied for a job in the US, as a computer programmer, and landed it. I remember an early childhood in California, where my father worked as a computer programmer for PeopleSoft.

Long story short, throughout my childhood, both my parents emphasized the importance of education and gave us many, many opportunities, educationally, athletically, creatively... I remember computer science influenced me greatly as I grew up, and my parents did fixate on having me enter college as an engineering student in the field of technology.

I graduated high school here in the US, then attended Yonsei University in South Korea as an engineering student. My major was Computer Science. There, I spent two (rigorous) years, and then, without delving too deeply into the reasons (family-related), transferred back into a college university here in the US. 

College tuition here significantly impacted my ability to take on credits. It was expensive. So I spent time working to earn money, working on myself, being with family... I knew that Software Engineering was the path I wanted to take, but I was certainly struggling, financially, mentally, and left unable to continue my education properly due to those obstacles. I already knew what I wanted to do. It was just that I needed to navigate the way there.

This is where Flatiron School entered the picture. The ISA option made studying in the FT Software Engineering cohort financially viable, and I jumped at the opportunity. Either way, now, I'm here and ready to work alongside my fellow students. I've got a strong love for the field, and it certainly doesn't hurt that career prospects and potential future income appear promising.

The only thing left to do is follow through with my studies in the following months. I'm super excited to see what happens next, and I will do my utmost best to learn and succeed.

With that, I conclude my first blog post, on what brought me to Software Engineering.
